== Reddit Cloned
This Reddit clone is missing a bit of formating, but implements nested comments,
showing off the comment trees that are such a hallmark of the Reddit community.
Further, it avoid's N+1 queries in the nested comments by grabbing all of the 
comments for a post at once, and then determining how the should be nested. This
prevents running into scalability issues, especially with particularly popular 
posts.
